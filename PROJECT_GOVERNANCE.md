# Project Governance

The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. If this decision making process takes too long or a decision is required, the project committee has the authority to make a decision.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the code-base. Maintainers have the following responsibilities

1. Coordinate development activity
1. Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
1. Coordinate pull-requests
1. Coordinate bug follow-ups
1. Coordinate questions
1. In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or other can request a community council decision.

The current maintainers of this project are:
 1. Nico Rikken - Alliander OSPO

## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
